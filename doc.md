# Codebase Documentation

This document provides a high-level overview of the codebase, acting as a tutorial for newcomers. It covers the main projects, their components, and key functionalities.

## I. DocAider-Gemini

### Overview

DocAider-Gemini is a tool for generating, updating, and managing documentation for software repositories, potentially leveraging the Gemini language model. It includes features for code analysis, documentation generation, and website creation.

### Folder Structure and Key Components

### Key Functionalities and Flows

1.  **Documentation Generation:**
    *   The core functionality revolves around generating documentation for a given code repository.
    *   `generate_docs_cli_local.py`: Serves as the entry point for generating documentation locally.
    *   `repo_agents/`: Contains agents that analyze the code and generate documentation. It has a `single_agent_generation` and `multi_agent_generation` directories.
        *   `documentation_agent.py`: An agent that uses single agent generation for documentation.
        *   `code_context_agent.py`, `git_repo_agent.py`, `multi_agent_conversation.py`: Agents for multi agent generation.
    *   `repo_documentation/`: Contains logic for the documentation generation.
        *   `merger.py`: Contains logic for merging different documentation sections.
    *   The `rag/` directory contains code for Retrieval Augmented Generation, which might be used to improve documentation quality by retrieving relevant information.
2.  **Repository Analysis:**
    *   The tool analyzes the repository's structure and code to understand its components and dependencies.
    *   `repo_utils/github_manager.py`: Manages interactions with GitHub repositories.
3.  **Website Generation:**
    *   The generated documentation is used to create a website for easy access and navigation.
    *   `website/`: Contains the source code for the documentation website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
4.  **Caching:**
    *   Caching is used to improve performance by storing previously generated documentation.
    *   `cache/docs_cache.py`: Manages the documentation cache.
5.  **Workflows:**
    *   GitHub Actions workflows automate tasks such as testing and deployment.
    *   `.github/workflows/`: Contains workflow definitions for testing and deploying the website.
6.  **Repo validation**
    *   Validates structure of the repo.
    *   `repo_validation/app.py`: main app to validate.

## II. Calcpy

### Overview

Without the code content, it's challenging to determine what `calcpy` does. Based on the file names, it might be a calculator-related utility or library.

### Folder Structure and Key Components

```
calcpy/
├── tests/             # Test suits.
├── __init__.py        # Initialize file.
├── __main__.py        # Main entry point.
├── autostore.py       # Auto storage.
├── currency.py        # Currency util.
├── formatters.py      # Formatters.
├── info.py            # Info.
├── new-file.py         #
├── transformers.py    # Transformers.
├── user.py            # User utilities.
└── utils.py           # Utilities.
```

### Key Functionalities (Inferred from Filenames)

1.  **Calculator Functionality:**
    *   The project likely provides some form of calculator functionality, possibly with support for currency conversions and custom formatting.
    *   `currency.py`: Deals with currency-related operations.
    *   `formatters.py`: Handles formatting of calculator output.
    *   `transformers.py`: Might perform transformations on input or output values.
2.  **User Customization:**
    *   The `user.py` file suggests that the project allows for some level of user customization.
3.  **Auto Storage**:
    *   The `autostore.py` file suggests that the project automatically stores result.

## III. Previewer

### Overview

Again, without access to the file contents, it is hard to infer the purpose.

### Folder Structure and Key Components

```
previewer/
├── __init__.py        # Initialize file.
└── __main__.py        # Main entry point.
```

## Recommendations for Further Exploration

1.  **DocAider-Gemini:**
    *   Examine the code within `repo_agents/` to understand how the documentation is generated.
    *   Explore the `website/` directory to understand how the documentation is presented.
    *   Run `generate_docs_cli_local.py` to see the documentation generation process in action.
2.  **Calcpy:**
    *   Examine the code within to understand the functionalities.
3.  **Previewer:**
    *   Examine the code within to understand the functionalities.

By following these steps, you can gain a better understanding of the codebase and its functionality, which will help you document it effectively.
